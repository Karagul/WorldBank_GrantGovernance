In developing countries with high level of corruption, governance become worst when they receive grants from the World Bank. 


```{r data_import}
# The data are imported bellow. The first one have data about grants fom the World. The second have the index of control for corruption. Higher index of control for corruption is a better performance.

A scatter plot of the linkage between grants and government effecctiveness is presented below. It shows that the World Bank tends not to account for how the population perceive their governments effectiveness to grant funds to their countries.

```{r graphglobal,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#cor(DatFinal$Grant,DatFinal$Control)
gg1 <- ggplot(DatFinal, aes(x=Control, y=Grant)) + 
  geom_point(col='forestgreen',size=2,shape=1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F,col='blue') + 
  #facet_wrap(~Region) +
  #xlim(c(0, 0.1)) + 
  #ylim(c(0, 500000)) + 
  labs(#subtitle="Area Vs Population", 
       y="Grant", 
       x="Government Effectiveness", 
      # title="Linkage between Grant from the World Bank and Governement Effectiveness", 
       caption = "Source: Graphic by Raulin L. Cadet, with data from the World Bank")+
  theme_classic()

gg1+geom_text(aes(x=0,y=1400,label=paste("p-value=",round(cor.test(Grant,Control)$p.value,digits = 2))),col='red')

```

Considering a scotter plot, for the same variables, but by region, only the graphic related to Africa reveals that grants tend to increase with high perception of government effectiveness. However, this relation seems to bo weak. Considering East Asia and Pacific, the curve estimating the raltion between grants and government effectiveness is almost flat, showing no relation between them. For the other regions, the relation is not consistent, suggesting that the World Bank is not following a rule related to government effectiveness to grant fund.

The absence of such a rule sould not encourage government of developing countries to improve the effectiveness of public policy.


Let us verify if there is a significant linear relationship between the grants and government effectiveness.

```{r correlatRegion}

cor<-DatFinal%>%                              # Calculating the correlation coefficient (method of Pearson)
  group_by(Region)%>%                         # Grouping by region
  summarise(cor.test(Control,Grant)$estimate)

pVal<-DatFinal%>%                             # Calculating the p-value of the correlation by region
  group_by(Region)%>%
  summarise(cor.test(Control,Grant)$p.value)
```


```{r graphic2,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Merging the data frame 'DatFInal' with data related to p-value for correlation test by region
# to include p-value in the following graphic
datfinal<-inner_join(DatFinal, pVal, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c(".grant", ".corrup") )
colnames(datfinal)<-c(colnames(DatFinal)[1:5],"P_value")


gg2 <- ggplot(datfinal, aes(x=Control, y=Grant)) + # Scatter plot linking 'Grant' and 'Control'
  geom_point(col='forestgreen',size=2,shape=1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F,col='blue') +    # Design the linear relationship (blue line)
  
  facet_wrap(~Region)+                             # Design a graphic by region
  labs(subtitle="By Region (2002-2015)", 
       y="Grant", 
       x="Government Effectiveness", 
       title="Linkage between Grant from the World Bank and Governement Effectiveness",
