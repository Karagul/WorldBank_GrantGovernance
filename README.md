# Does the World Bank account for government effectiveness when granting funds to developing countries

It is well documented that bad governance and corruption adversely affect economic growth and development (Fayissa and Nsiah, 2013; Cooray, 2009, Seldadyo et al., 2007). In this case, aid to development may be ineffective when the governance is bad in beneficiariesâ€™ countries. Indeed, Countries with bad governance may not use efficiently the aid. However, during the recent decades, as underlined by Kaufmann (2009), aid tends to be more sensitive to supporting policy reform in developing countries. Such policies should improve governance and reduce corruption. 

In spite that donors are more sensitive to supporting policy reform, it is possible that some beneficiaries do not improve governance, and do continue to apply ineffective economic policies. If donors, such as the World Bank, continue to grant funds to countries with bad governance, their aid is wasting money. To ensure that aid is effective, the decision to grant fund should account for progress improving governance.

The donors, such as the World Bank, usually monitor and evaluate the result of the projects related to funds they granted to developing countries (REF). If we consider the World Bank which is one of the leading advocator of good governance, does it account for the quality of governance when deciding to grant funds to developing countries? The World Bank has published several indicators related to the quality of governance: voice and accountability; political stability and absence of violence/terrorism; government effectiveness; regulatory quality; rule of law; control of corruption. Considering the World Bank, this paper argues that although it is a leading promoter of governance, it does not account for government effectiveness to grant funds to developing countries.
